This will run the scripts and allow for all three scripts to work at the same time to display the song using sfml, get the current song from queue, and start the playback on the raspberry pi device. 

TODO: 
  - post the control to the front end if pause or play
  - poll the front end api/control to get the front end controller and place into remote.txt file
  - Create an bash script to run through all necesssary installs
